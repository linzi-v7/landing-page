# Landing Page

This repository contains a landing page project developed using HTML and CSS. It showcases a simple yet structured design, employing semantic HTML elements and basic CSS styling techniques. This project is my second in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) web development course and marks my first experience in building a site with more than just HTML.
